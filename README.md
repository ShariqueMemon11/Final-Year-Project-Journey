# Kicking Off Our FYP Journey  

On **January 18, 2025**, my friends **Mohamid**, **Daniyal**, and I sat down to start the brainstorming process for our Final Year Project (FYP).  

What started as a serious discussion quickly turned into a mix of laughter, ideas, and friendly banter.  

- 🎉 We tossed around some wild suggestions (some of which were more jokes than ideas).  
- 😂 Took turns cracking jokes about each other's brainstorming skills.  
- 🧠 Narrowed down a few solid concepts and started thinking about the direction we wanted to take.  

It wasn’t just about ideas—it was about enjoying the process and making sure this journey would be as fun as it is productive.  

## More updates (and probably more jokes) to come soon! 🚀 Stay tuned!

## FYP Update: Remembering We Actually Have Work to Do 🤦‍♂️  

After spending two whole days doing absolutely nothing productive (unless you count scrolling memes😁),
we suddenly remembered, “Oh right, we have an FYP to work on!😯” So, on January 20, 2025, we decided to do something (for now😊).  

**Today, I actually did something useful—I reached out to the FYP manager of our university.
 My HOD suggested that I should email him with the ideas we discussed (yes, the ones we came up with between jokes and chaos).
 So, I asked if any of them were good enough to work on or if he had a golden idea up his sleeve for us.**  

Now, we’re waiting for a response. Fingers crossed it’s not, “Please come up with better ideas.” 🤞  

More updates (and probably more jokes) to come soon! 🚀 Stay tuned!
