# Kicking Off Our FYP Journey  

On **January 18, 2025**, my friends **Mohamid**, **Daniyal**, and I sat down to start the brainstorming process for our Final Year Project (FYP).  

What started as a serious discussion quickly turned into a mix of laughter, ideas, and friendly banter.  

- ðŸŽ‰ We tossed around some wild suggestions (some of which were more jokes than ideas).  
- ðŸ˜‚ Took turns cracking jokes about each other's brainstorming skills.  
- ðŸ§  Narrowed down a few solid concepts and started thinking about the direction we wanted to take.  

It wasnâ€™t just about ideasâ€”it was about enjoying the process and making sure this journey would be as fun as it is productive.  

## More updates (and probably more jokes) to come soon! ðŸš€ Stay tuned!  

## Here are the idea that thought:
